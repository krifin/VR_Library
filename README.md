Integrating humanistic inquiry & knowledge  with cutting-edge technology and design. Through our open source library, we explore the various innovative, interdisciplinary ways of showcasing art and culture through immersive installations, exhibitions, films, digital publications, and other multimedia forms.In some instances, digital technology and sensorial techniques breathe new life into an archival record. In others, itâ€™s the archival record that lends form, substance, and nuance to projects that begin as aesthetic concepts.


The Krifin Metaverse Library is Aims to build an open source library which utlizes the architechure of ApertusVR thereby offering a brand new "no vendor lock-in" approach for virtual and augmented reality on different operating systems and on different virtual and augmented reality hardware.

This higher abstraction level enables that the business logic has to be implemented once and then it works on any platform. Moreover these different virtual and augmented reality hardware can be shared a same virtual reality scene at the same time allowing an enchanced metaverse experience.
