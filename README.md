The Krifin Metaverse Library is Aims to build an open source library which utlizes the architechure of ApertusVR thereby offering a brand new "no vendor lock-in" approach for virtual and augmented reality on different operating systems and on different virtual and augmented reality hardware.
This higher abstraction level enables that the business logic has to be implemented once and then it works on any platform. Moreover these different virtual and augmented reality hardware can be shared a same virtual reality scene at the same time.
The ApertusVR engine only contains libraries in order to easily integrate the virtual and augmented reality technologies into an already existing product. By the help of the factory plugins and samples ApertusVR could boosts up the creation of a minimum viable product from scratch.
